# Recognize Celebrity
 A software that builds a database and can recognize many famous people

# Steps
1. Find all the celebrities. I have createed a few websites to go to and searching through google for a few people not included. 
2. Encode the faces and build files to read from. This is basically going through the training data
3. Test it on photos.
4. Could add it for videos and finding people in them.

# Extra notes
I am going to use the base recognition for this project which can be inaccurate at times. An improvement could be made later on but for now It is more on focusing on building the database of people.
