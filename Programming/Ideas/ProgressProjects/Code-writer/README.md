# Code writer
 Find code that is on Stack Overflow and using inputed target write its own code

# Steps
1. Ask for input from the user what we are going to write about. From that point we write down the main platform
2. Split up the individual elements into certain lines of code. This turning our words into psuedo code
3. Search for the code online in StackOverflow and potentially Codeforces as those are huge places of solutions
4. Write the code and compile that it works. If not, write the errors in an extra file
5. Consider it complete and wait for user to fix it themselves

Could improve with more sites reading from, more specific parameters, and a prebuilt knowledge of a few algorithms after time.
